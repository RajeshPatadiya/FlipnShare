Inside, diners float on white cushions in transparent, plastic chairs or lounge in booths that incorporate green accent colors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apeiro's menu falls in line with its smart atmosphere. Forest mushroom flatbread or caprese appetizers set the scene for main entrees, like Nonna's meatballs, which come swimming in tomato sauce alongside local ricotta cheese and fresh basil. Tastes from other regions include the French dip gyro, stuffed with prime rib, and the roasted lamb chops in a rosemary-lavender rub.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To top off the meal, guests can order an interactive dessert \u2013 the sweet potato bombolini comes with roasted white chocolate, brandy caramel and raspberry sauces in squeeze bottles, so diners can fill their sugary treats with favorite flavors. Other selections include the coconut gelato and seven-layer chocolate cake.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apeiro Kitchen &amp; Bar \/ 14917 Lyons Road, Delray Beach <a href=\"apeirorestaurants.com\" target=\"_blank\">apeirorestaurants.com<\/a><\/p>\r\n"}
